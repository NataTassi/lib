A QR code (an initialism for quick response code) is a type of matrix barcode that is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. QR codes use four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.

Dependencies: pip3 install qrcode opencv-python


Generate QR code:

import qrcode
data = "https://duckduckgo.com"
img = qrcode.make(data)
img.save("img.png")


Read QR code:

import cv2
img = cv2.imread("img.png")
detector = cv2.QRCodeDetector()
data, pts, bin_data = detector.detectAndDecode(img)
print(data)
