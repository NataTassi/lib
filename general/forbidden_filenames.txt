1. The forbidden printable ASCII characters are:

    Linux/Unix:
      / (forward slash)

    Windows:
      < (less than)
      > (greater than)
      : (colon - sometimes works, but is actually NTFS Alternate Data Streams)
      " (double quote)
      / (forward slash)
      \ (backslash)
      | (vertical bar or pipe)
      ? (question mark)
      * (asterisk)


2. Non-printable characters

If your data comes from a source that would permit non-printable characters then there is more to check for.
    Linux/Unix: 0 (NULL byte)
    Windows: 0-31 (ASCII control characters)

Note: While it is legal under Linux/Unix file systems to create files with control characters in the filename, it might be a nightmare for the users to deal with such files.


3. Reserved file names

The following filenames are reserved:
    Windows:
      CON, PRN, AUX, NUL 
      COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9
      LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9
    (both on their own and with arbitrary file extensions, e.g. LPT1.txt).


4. Other rules

    Windows: Filenames cannot end in a space or dot.
    macOS: You didn't ask for it, but just in case: Colon : and forward slash / depending on context are not permitted (e.g. Finder supports slashes, terminal supports colons).
