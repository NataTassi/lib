To get consistent memory addresses when running the program and debugging it with gdb:

* Make sure to disable ASLR with 'sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0 #no random'.
Running directly: env -i PWD=$(pwd) $(pwd)/<binary>  (you can pipe input into the binary by piping it to env)
Running with gdb: env -i gdb <binary> < <(cat gdb.txt -) (you can read input with 'r < file')

gdb.txt:
unset env LINES
unset env COLUMNS
set disassembly-flavor intel
