To run a 32-bit executable file on a 64-bit multi-architecture system, you have to add the i386 architecture and install the three library packages libc6:i386, libncurses5:i386, and libstdc++6:i386:
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
(may be needed) sudo apt-get install multiarch-support

After these steps, you should be able to run the 32-bit application:
./example32bitprogram

Note: you cat get a "No such file or directory" error when executing a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit distro if you don't have the needed library packages
