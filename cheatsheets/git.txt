Password authentification was removed from CLI, but you can use tokens.
To create a personal access token to use in place of a pass with the CLI:
    Log into GitHub -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Generate new token


Clone online repo into an offline one:
git clone [link].git            


Create a new repository on the command line:

Create and move to a new folder
echo "# Description" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<user>/<project>.git
git push -u origin master


Update local repo:
git pull


Update remote (cloud) repo:
git pull                   // ALWAYS do this before making any changes in the local repo
Add, delete, or modify files
git add .                  // use only if you added new files 
git commit -a -m "comment" // apply changes 
git push                   // update online repo


Remove directory:
git rm -r dir-name
git commit -m "note"
git push -u origin master


Fix merge errors:

If you mean you want the pull to overwrite local changes, doing the merge as if the working tree were clean, well, clean the working tree:
git reset --hard
git pull

If there are untracked local files you could use git clean to remove them. Use git clean -f to remove untracked files, -df to remove untracked files and directories, and -xdf to remove untracked or ignored files or directories.

If on the other hand you want to keep the local modifications somehow, you'd use stash to hide them away before pulling, then reapply them afterwards:
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
I don't think it makes any sense to literally ignore the changes, though - half of pull is merge, and it needs to merge the committed versions of content with the versions it fetched.
