Program arguments:

The system starts a C program by calling the function main. It is up to you to write a function named main—otherwise, you won’t even be able to link your program without errors.
In ISO C you can define main either to take no arguments, or to take two arguments that represent the command line arguments to the program, like this:
    int main (int argc, char *argv[])
The command line arguments are the whitespace-separated tokens given in the shell command used to invoke the program; thus, in ‘cat foo bar’, the arguments are ‘foo’ and ‘bar’. The only way a program can look at its command line arguments is via the arguments of main. If main doesn’t take arguments, then you cannot get at the command line.
The value of the argc argument is the number of command line arguments. The argv argument is a vector of C strings; its elements are the individual command line argument strings. The file name of the program being run is also included in the vector as the first element; the value of argc counts this element. A null pointer always follows the last element: argv[argc] is this null pointer.
For the command ‘cat foo bar’, argc is 3 and argv has three elements, "cat", "foo" and "bar".
In Unix systems you can define main a third way, using three arguments:
    int main (int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
The first two arguments are just the same. The third argument envp gives the program’s environment; it is the same as the value of environ. 


Getting and setting user privileges:

Needed header: <unistd.h>
getuid()    returns the real user ID of the calling process.
geteuid()   returns the effective user ID of the calling process.
getgid()    analogous to getuid()
getegid()   analogous to geteuid()
setresuid() sets the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the calling process.
setresgid() analogous to setresuid() for group IDs


Needed header: <stdio.h>
int printf(const char *format, ...):                 print formatted data to stdout
int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...):  print formatted data to stream
int dprintf(int fd, const char *format, ...):        print formatted data to file descriptor
int sprintf(char *str, const char *format, ...):     print formatted data to string buffer (requires large enough buffer)
int asprintf(char **restrict str, const char *restrict format, ...): print formatted data to automatically sized and allocated string buffer
See: man 3 printf
scanf(const char *format, ...):   reads data from stdin and stores them according to the parameter format into the locations pointed by the additional arguments
See: man scanf

Format specifiers:

Format specifiers define the type of data to be printed on standard output. You need to use format 
specifiers whether you're printing formatted output with printf() or accepting input with scanf().

%c	a single character
%s	a string
%hi	short (signed)
%hu	short (unsigned)
%Lf	long double
%n	prints nothing
%d	a decimal integer (assumes base 10)
%i	a decimal integer (detects the base automatically)
%o	an octal (base 8) integer
%x	a hexadecimal (base 16) integer
%p	an address (or pointer)
%f	a floating point number for floats
%u	int unsigned decimal
%e	a floating point number in scientific notation
%E	a floating point number in scientific notation
%%	the % symbol


Needed header: <stdlib.h>
getenv(var): get an environment variable
system(cmd): execute a shell command
