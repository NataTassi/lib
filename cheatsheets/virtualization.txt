Virtual Machines

A virtual computer system is known as a “virtual machine” (VM): a tightly isolated software container with an operating system and application inside. 
Each self-contained VM is completely independent. Putting multiple VMs on a single computer enables several operating systems and applications to run on just one physical server, or “host.”
A thin layer of software called a “hypervisor” decouples the virtual machines from the host and dynamically allocates computing resources to each virtual machine as needed.
The hypervisor emulates resources so the guest operating systems assume they are using all physical resources. They don’t see the host OS nor other VMs running on the same resources. 
There are two types of hypervisors: 
- Type 1 bare metal hypervisor, which are installed on the physical server. 
- Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors, installed on top of the host operating system. 
While type 1 is more suitable for large production environments, hosted hypervisors are used for VMs run on personal computers. The most popular type 2 hypervisor software are VirtualBox and VMware.

Key Properties of Virtual Machines:

* Partitioning
    - Run multiple operating systems on one physical machine.
    - Divide system resources between virtual machines.
* Isolation
    - Provide fault and security isolation at the hardware level.
    - Preserve performance with advanced resource controls.
* Encapsulation
    - Save the entire state of a virtual machine to files.
    - Move and copy virtual machines as easily as moving and copying files. 
* Hardware Independence
    - Provision or migrate any virtual machine to any physical server.


Virtual machines networking configurations:
- Host-only: only permits network operations with the Host OS (and other VMs connected to the same host-only network).
- NAT: will mask all network activity as if it came from your Host OS (as a router does), the VM will be assigned in a separate subnet.
- Bridged: replicates another node on the physical network and your VM will receive it's own IP address if DHCP is enabled in the network.


Troubleshooting:

Missing Kernel Headers: 
apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
(The path to the kernel headers is then /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include)
