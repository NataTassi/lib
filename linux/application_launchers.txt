Create a text file with a .desktop extension in your ~/.local/share/applications directory, for example ~/.local/share/applications/studio.desktop

Include at least the following lines, which tell the desktop how to launch the application.
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Android Studio
Exec=studio.sh
Type=Application
Icon=studio

This assumes that the executable, studio.sh, exists somewhere in your search path, e.g. in ~/.local/bin or in ./bin. Else, provide the full pathname to the executable script, e.g. Exec=/home/user/path/to/studio.sh.
This assumes that the icon is called studio.png and that the icon is in a standard place, e.g. ~/.local/share/studio.png. Else, provide the full pathname to the icon file, e.g. Icon=/home/user/path/to/studio.png.
If the script does not launch a graphical application, but instead should run in a terminal emulator, include a line Terminal=true.

A valid .desktop file in a valid location, with a valid command on the exec= line will automatically, within seconds, appear in your menu system and be searchable.

More fields are available. Study some files under /usr/share/applications to see how it works.
