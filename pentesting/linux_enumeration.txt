Enumeration:

find / -type f -name "*flag*" 2>/dev/null | less

hostname: Get hostname (it can provide info)

uname -a: System information

cat /proc/version: The proc filesystem (procfs) provides information about the target system processes. It may provide info on the kernel version and additional data such as whether a compiler (e.g. GCC) is installed.

cat /etc/issue: This file usually contains some information about the operating system but can easily be changed.

ps: See the running processes on a Linux system, typing ps on your terminal will show processes for the current shell.
- PID: The process ID (unique to the process)
- TTY: Terminal type used by the user
- Time: Amount of CPU time used by the process (this is NOT the time this process has been running for)
- CMD: The command or executable running (will NOT display any command line parameter)

env: Show environmental variables
The PATH variable may have a compiler or a scripting language (e.g. Python) that could be used to run code on the target system or leveraged for privilege escalation.

sudo -l: The target system may be configured to allow users to run some (or all) commands with root privileges. The sudo -l command can be used to list all commands your user can run using sudo.

ls -la: List all files, you may find useful data.

id: The id command will provide a general overview of the user’s privilege level and group memberships. It is worth remembering that the id command can also be used to obtain the same information for another user with: id <user>

cat /etc/passwd: Easy way to discover users on the system. While the output can be long and a bit intimidating, it can easily be cut and converted to a useful list for brute-force attacks with: cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1
Remember that this will return all users, some of which are system or service users that would not be very useful. Another approach could be to grep for “home” as real users will most likely have their folders under the “home” directory: cat /etc/passwd | grep home

history: Looking at earlier commands with the history command can give us some idea about the target system and, albeit rarely, have stored information such as passwords or usernames.

ifconfig: The target system may be a pivoting point to another network. The ifconfig command will give us information about the network interfaces of the system. This can be confirmed using the ip route command to see which network routes exist.

netstat: Following an initial check for existing interfaces and network routes, it is worth looking into existing communications. The netstat command can be used with several different options to gather information on existing connections. Add --help to those parameters carefully. Some of them include: -a (all) -t (only TCP), -u (only UDP), -s (stats by protocol), -i (interface stats) or the famous -ano (all, don't resolve names, and display timers).

find: Search for important info and potential privilege escalation vectors.
